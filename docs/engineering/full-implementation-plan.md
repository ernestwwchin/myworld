# W1 Full Implementation Plan

Source: `docs/ideas/raw/mod-system-brainstorm.md` (4000+ lines)
Scope: Everything needed for a complete Act 1 — town → 5 dungeon floors → boss → victory → town return.

## Status Legend
- [x] Done (in codebase or on `feat/w1-mod-system` branch)
- [~] Partial (exists but incomplete)
- [ ] Not started

---

## Phase 0: Engine Primitives (DONE — `feat/w1-mod-system`)

Standalone modules with unit tests, not yet wired into game.

- [x] #1 AbilityRunner — eval+call with `with(this){}`, 17 action + 16 check + 2 roll methods
- [x] #2 BoostRunner — stat modifier runner (ac, str, advantage, resistance, etc.)
- [x] #3 recalcBoosts(actor) — iterate statuses + equipment, cache `actor.derived`
- [x] #4 useAbility() pipeline — condition → onCast → roll → onHit/onMiss
- [x] #5 StatusEngine — source tracking, stackId/stackPriority, onReapply modes
- [x] #6 Combat ability defs — Attack/Dash/Disengage/Hide/Flee/Dodge/Help as data
- [x] #7 Damage pipeline — 10 types, immunity/resistance/vulnerability multipliers
- [x] #8 Resource system — action + bonusAction + movement + reaction
- [x] #9 AI profiles — basic/ranged/support with trigger-based ability selection
- [x] #10 Creature extends: — deep-merge inheritance resolver

## Phase 1: Wire Engine Into Game (DONE)

### 1A. Status engine wiring
- [x] Wire `StatusEngine.applyStatus()` via `applyStatusToActor()` mixin
- [x] Wire `StatusEngine.removeStatusBySource()` via `removeStatusesBySource()` mixin
- [x] Wire `recalcBoosts()` on apply/remove — cache `actor.derived`
- [ ] Emit `statsChanged` event on boost change → update side panel UI

### 1B. Damage pipeline wiring
- [x] Inline resistance/vulnerability/immunity check in `playerAttackEnemy()`
- [x] Read `actor.derived.resistances/immunities/vulnerabilities` from creature YAML
- [x] Float text shows "(resisted)", "(vulnerable!)", "IMMUNE" labels
